## Search similar images


This code allows you to search for images that are similar to a given image using ResNet50, a popular deep learning model for image recognition. The script uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Nearest Neighbors algorithm to create a compressed index that enables a fast search for nearest neighbors in the space of image features.
